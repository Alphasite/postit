CS 5431 Post It Project

To run the system in a GUI, open the project in a Java IDE. Change the working directory in Configurations to where you would like your Keychain files to be stored. Now run the main method in KeychainViewer.java.
You will be prompted for a master password (if this is your first time running the system, you will be setting your master password)

From here, there you have to option of creating a keychain, then adding a password. Once you have a keychain and a password, you can add or delete keychains and add, edit, or delete passwords.
